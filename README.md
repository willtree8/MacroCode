# MacroCode
an AHK-based modular 3 digit code-based macro system.

## Info
This is a super simple project, intended to manage your hundreds of macros.
Hate typing CtrlShiftAltWinSpaceTab+2 because there were no other available combos? MacroCode can replace all that with a simple 3 digit code.

*Not responsible for bugs and any problems encountered*

## Installation
1) Download [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2) Download MacroCode
3) Add your own AHK scripts
4) Run `MacroCode.exe` or add to startup

## Usage
To use, install then add your own scripts.
Scripts should be named `num.txt`
(e.g. `001.txt`)
The scripts are simply autohotkey code, learn more about that [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm)

To open the menu, press `Ctrl`+`Q`. Then, type the appropriate code and hit enter! Then, MacroCode will execute the appropriate script.

`999.txt` is included as an example.

## Modification
If you decide you want to add/change something, MacroCode.ahk is the source - go for it!
